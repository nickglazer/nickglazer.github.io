## Summary

Ever since playing Minecraft back in 2011, I've been interested in procedural generation methods and finally had the time to dive in a little bit. This repo is my experimentation with any procedural generation technique, generative art, simulation, and image processing that catches my fancy.

I always really enjoyed image processing and was lucky enough to work on a billiary endoscope and on multiple MSI/HSI cameras. I was also fortunate to get to take a course on computer vision at USF.
