## Summary

After using the [Yocto Project](http://yoctoproject.org){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} at work, I wanted to be able to use [QP](https://www.state-machine.com/products/qp/){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} on Embedded Linux but there was no recipe. I ended up writing one for QP/C++. It took me a while to understand all of the nuances of the Yocto system while writing it. I would still like to write a recipe for QP/C and get them released for full use.
