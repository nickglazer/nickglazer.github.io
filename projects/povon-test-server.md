## Summary

When I was in my final year at USF, I was reconnected with a classmate from high school who was studying Electrical Engineering at USF. He had a startup he was working on called the [Povon Power Monitor(read his blog post here)](https://coytbarringer.com/2018/05/){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I briefly worked with them to help build a test harness to collect the data that the prototype was emitting for analysis.

This project was a Python webserver that ran on a RaspberryPi to persist the data and also display instaneous readings such as the total power of the last reading on a seven segment display.
