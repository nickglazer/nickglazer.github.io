One of my favorite exercises for staying sharp is doing [code katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I particularly enjoy doing code katas on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/%20nickglazer){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} because of the way in which they track your progress by programming language and the way in which the katas are tagged by topic. 

I am currently aiming to get to the rank of 1 kyu by the end of 2021, I've mostly been doing Python and JavaScript katas involving interpreters, parsers, compilers, and advanced language features. This is great practice with stuff that I would never get to see in my day job, like the [Shunting Yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) or `ROLLUP` in SQL.
