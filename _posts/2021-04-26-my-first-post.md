I've been meaning to redo my personal website and portfolio for a long time. I previously had a fork of {% include github-link.html label="github/personal-website" %} that was pretty basic. I wanted to be able to have more flexibility in showing GitHub projects as cards and also showing a blog post about that project. I've also been wanting to have a better way to show off my [resume]({% link resume.html %}) and [cover letter]({% link about.md %}) so having tabs dedicated to them was another requirement.

I'm going to try my hand at crafting some blog posts if I can come up with some interesting topics. We'll see how it goes.
