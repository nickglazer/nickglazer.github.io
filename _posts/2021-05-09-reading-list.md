I set a goal for myself after graduating that I would read the "top" software and computer science books. I put that in quotes because I label them as "top" books through a bit of crowdsourcing of articles and not from some official ranking. I ended up with a list of 18 books. To anyone who wants to increase the amount of reading they do, I recommend [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) to track your reading and a Kindle.
