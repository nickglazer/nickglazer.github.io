I am a software development team lead at [SharpSpring](https://sharpspring.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

I earned a degree in Computer Science at the University of South Florida. I started my career in medical device firmware at Nypro(now Jabil Healthcare). After a few years there, I founded a web development agency, [Arcanium](https://arcanium.io){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, with some friends. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic made selling quite the obstacle so that's when I took the transition to work for [SharpSpring](https://sharpspring.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
