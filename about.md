My name is Nick and I’m passionate about problem solving; I seek out sophisticated projects that challenge me in new ways and hone my skills as a software developer.

I earned a degree in Computer Science at the University of South Florida and started my career in medical device firmware at [Nypro(now Jabil Healthcare Engineering & Technology)](https://www.jabil.com/industries/healthcare.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. After a few years there, I co-founded a web development agency, [Arcanium](https://arcanium.io){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, with some friends. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic made selling quite difficult and I transitioned to work for [SharpSpring](https://sharpspring.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} as a Senior Software Developer and Team Lead. Arcanium has since been restarted by some others involved in the original venture and has a promising future!

In my previous roles, I have worked as a full-stack web developer for websites and an Embedded Software Engineer. Working on large embedded software teams, and at multiple startups, honed my abilities on how to build effective relationships and how to navigate complex organizations—all while maximizing outcomes. In my role as a Lead Developer, I worked within the Agile framework to elevate my team and support the work that they do, supporting a multifaceted sales and marketing automation platform. 

My history with C++, micro-controllers, embedded Linux, C#, .NET applications, image processing for multi-spectral cameras, and full-stack web development, as well as a Computer Science B.S., cultivates a unique perspective in how I approach software. From the hardware that devices operate, to the browsers that interface with them, my experience is from-the-ground-up.

Finding new solutions to blockers that my team and I encounter reinvigorates my passion for software and drives me to continue my personal and professional development.
